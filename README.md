# Repository Structure
Data Files:
Folder with the dataset of final computed indicies ready for visualisation or other analysis, as well as all of the lookup files required to perform the estimation techniques detailed in the Estimation folder scripts. Indices starting with m_ refer to male attainment measures, w_ refer to female attainment and g_ refers to the equality measure.

Estimation:
Folder containing all of the scripts and details to perform Boundary-Sensitive Neighbourhood estimation. Also contains the details of the initial regression analyses and grid search sensitivity analysis which underpin the design of the estimator. See estimator_details for more information.

Other Domains:
Folder containing the scripts to wrangle and compute all other data sources which were not subject to the estimation procedure. Scripts are labelled according to their data source

Aggregation and Visualisation:
Folder with the scripts for the functions used to compute, aggregate and visualise the indices. Also included is an example choropleth visualisation for reference and an overview of the index structure to assist reproducability.
